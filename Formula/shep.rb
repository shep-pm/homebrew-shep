# The formula published to the tap at shep-pm/homebrew-shep, where it
# lives as Formula/shep.rb. This copy is the source of truth; the `homebrew`
# job in .github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml rewrites the two version
# lines and pushes the result to the tap on every release.
#
# Builds from source rather than from the release archives, which is
# deliberate for now. Bumping a source formula is one url and one sha256, both
# of which crates.io publishes; a binary formula carries a url and sha256 per
# platform and has nothing to point at until release-artifacts.yml has run
# against a real release. docs/distribution.md records when to switch.

  # The crate tarball rather than a GitHub tag archive. Its sha256 is

  # job reads the hash instead of downloading and computing one. GitHub
  # generates archive tarballs on the fly, which is the weaker guarantee of
  # the two.

    <<~EOS
      shep installs its own launchd job:

        shep startup      supervise the flock from login
        shep unstartup    undo that

      So this formula ships no `brew services` definition. Running both would
      leave two launchd jobs pointed at one shepherd.
